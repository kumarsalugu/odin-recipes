# odin-recipes

This is a simple project made with HTML. The project is about recipes of Indian snack items.

I used Simple HTML Tags as mentioned in the assignment. For the images of the recipes, I used unsplash.com as the source.

The main page is index.html. It contains links to three different recipes.
The recipes are stored in different folder named "recipes" where you will find the information regarding the ingredients used and steps needed to make each and every snack item.

Enjoyy!!!
